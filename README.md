# WSVPN Web

## What is this?

This is an implemention of a WSVPN client in TypeScript / JavaScript.

It allows testing to see if the WSVPN protocol really is the way a browser would use the protocols in use and is therefor a useful testbed to ensure our protocols look as much as possible as normal browsers.
